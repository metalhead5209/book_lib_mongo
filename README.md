# book_lib_mongo

Redeploy of the Book Library I built a few months back when following along with The Odin Project. I originally had it set up to save to local storage. I was looking through
some of my old apps and noticed something had broken and it was no longer saving the data. Instead of figuring out the problem (which I'm sure I could have if I tried) I, instead,
added a backend with Mongo to save the data. It helped me brush up on my non-relational dbs as I've been working with relational lately.
